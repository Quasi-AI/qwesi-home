# Shop Page Improvements: Pagination and Categories Filter

## Information Gathered
- Shop page fetches all products (limit=100) without pagination, leading to performance issues.
- Category filtering uses product.category field but lacks a dedicated interactive component.
- API supports page/limit params for server-side pagination.
- Quick categories exist but need a full Categories component for better UX.

## Plan Steps
- [x] Create components/Categories.jsx: Interactive list of unique categories with counts, clickable for filtering via URL params.
- [x] Update app/(public)/shop/page.jsx: Add pagination state (currentPage, productsPerPage=12), modify fetchProducts to include page/limit, add pagination UI (buttons, page numbers), reset page on filter changes, integrate Categories component as sidebar/toggle.
- [x] Test: Load /shop, apply category filter, paginate, verify API calls, mobile responsiveness.

## Dependent Files
- components/Categories.jsx (new)
- app/(public)/shop/page.jsx (update)

## Followup
- No new deps.
- Test with npm run dev, check Network for paginated requests.
