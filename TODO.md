# Task: Refactor Orders Page to Use Real API Data

## Current Progress
- [x] Analyze codebase and identify issues (dummy data bug)
- [x] Create plan and get user approval
- [x] Integrate authenticated API fetching in app/(public)/orders/page.jsx
- [ ] Update UI to handle loading and error states
- [ ] Fix order key from id to _id for API compatibility
- [ ] Verify order structure (address, items, etc.) and adjust OrderItem if needed
- [ ] Test functionality (fetch, display, auth handling)
- [ ] Integrate Redux for addresses if address not in order data
- [ ] Update empty state for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Final verification and completion

## Next Steps
1. Edit app/(public)/orders/page.jsx to add loading spinner and error display in the return statement.
2. Ensure order keys use _id instead of id in the map.
3. If API order structure differs (e.g., no address), read sample API response or adjust display.
4. Run `npm run dev` and test /orders page with auth.
5. Use browser_action to verify rendering if needed.
6. Mark as complete with attempt_completion once verified.
